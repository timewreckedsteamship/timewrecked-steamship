		<p class="col-xs-7 col-xs-offset-2 content">It's a steampunk camping event -- but not merely so.<br />
It's a blend of steampunk convention, Maker Faire, and Burning Man <br />
Really, it will be what you make it.<br /><br />
Crew/passengers/stow-aways are encouraged to bring whatever mad science you have wrought, as we do not know what opportunities for trade or conquest we may discover together.<br /> <br />
Programming, the likes of "how a steam engine works" and, of course, croquet and tea, is merely pageantry leading up to our maiden voyage exploring the unknown vastness.<br /><br />
Some of our engineers have cautioned that activating the time-engine will cause it to catch fire and suspect it will either malfunction or suck us uncontrolled into another time. But we are proceeding heedless in the spirit of adventure.<br /><br />
To help scout a location that is both steam and burn friendly, to help construct the time-engine, to suggest or present a program, or to volunteer in any other way, please email volunteer [at] timewreckedsteamship.com<br /><br />
